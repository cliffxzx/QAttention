\section{Experiments}

In our experiments, we focus on tasks that have short sequence input. We tested Transformer, FNet and QNet under same hyperparameters and classifier. For the text classification task, we use Cross Entropy loss to minimize the distance to the target.

We implemented the QNet with TensorFlow machine learning framework and TensorFlow Quantum to simulate quantum computer. The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/dj6082013/QNet.
